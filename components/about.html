          I am a highly motivated Aerospace Engineering graduate from Amirkabir University of Technology with a strong
          passion for artificial intelligence, computer vision, and machine learning. With hands-on experience in Python
          development, deep learning, and backend web development, I have successfully contributed to various projects,
          including sentiment analysis, neural network-based detection systems, and web applications. My academic
          background, combined with extensive self-driven research and project-based learning, has honed my
          problem-solving skills and technical expertise. Proficient in multiple programming languages and frameworks, I
          am eager to apply my knowledge in innovative AI and engineering solutions while continuously learning and
          evolving in the field.
